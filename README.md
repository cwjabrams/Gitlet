GITLET
========

Gitlet is a smaller version of the version control system Git. Gitlet
deals with three kinds of objects; blobs, trees and commits. Blobs are
file contents, trees are directory structures and commits are snapshots
of current work in the directory. Gitlet is simplified from git by reducing
the number of commands and options. Gitlet repositores contain only plain
files, not directories for further simplification from Git.
